# Zoe Edwards - Data Analysis Portfolio

# About
Hello, Im Zoe! I have a background in tourism, but currently I am on course to completing my degree in Global Development (MS. Global Development). I have established a strong base in data analysis and an enthusiasm for using data to help discover important and relevant insights. I am eager to bring my technical and analytical abilities to the field of data analysis as an entry-level data professional.

Since I started my studies I have improved my skills working with complex data and grew a sharp eye for recognizing patterns and trends. I have also acquired experience in data management and statistical analysis which I think will be valuable skills for my position as a data professional.

In my free time, I like to discover any new data analysis techniques, as I am always searching for a chance to develop my knowledge and abilities. I work well in a team and also independently, and I am motivated by the joy of uncovering new insights and the fulfillment of using data to work out complicated problems.

This is a repository to demonstrate my skills, share projects and record my progress in data analytics.

## Portfolio projects
In this section I will list my data analytic projects and describe the technology used to solve the cases

### Analyzing the lengths of penguins flippers and bills
**Code**: [`Penguins.ipynb`](https://github.com/Zoe-Elizabeth91/Zoe-Elizabeth91/blob/main/Penguins.ipynb)

**Goal**: To determine which species of penguin has the longest flipper and bill length.

**Description**: The project focused on analyzing the bill and flipper lengths of three different species of penguins.

**Skills**: scatterplot, grid colour, grid background.

**Technology**: Python, Pandas and Seaborn.

**Results**: Using the python functions the analysis found that that the penguin species 'Gentoo' had the biggest flipper and bill length.
