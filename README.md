# Zoe Edwards - Data Analysis Portfolio

# About
Hello, Im Zoe! I have a background in tourism, but currently I am on course to completing my degree in economics (MS. Economics). I have established a strong base in economics and an enthusiasm for using data to help discover important and relevant insights. I am eager to bring my technical and analytical abilities to the field of data analysis as an entry-level data professional.

Since I started my studies I have improved my skills working with complex data and grew a sharp eye for recognizing patterns and trends. I have also acquired experience in data management and statistical analysis which I think will be valuable skills for my position as a data professional.

In my free time, I like to discover any new data analysis techniques, as I am always searching for a chance to develop my knowledge and abilities. I work well in a team and also independently, and I am motivated by the joy of uncovering new insights and the fulfillment of using data to work out complicated problems.

This is a repository to demonstrate my skills, share projects and record my progress in data analytics.
