# Zoe Edwards - Data Analysis Portfolio

# About
Hello, Im Zoe! I have a background in tourism, but currently I am studying data analysis and the various programmes that can be used. I have established a strong base in data analysis and an enthusiasm for using data to help discover important and relevant insights. I am eager to bring my technical and analytical abilities to the field of data analysis as an entry-level data professional.

Since I started my studies I have improved my skills working with complex data and grew a sharp eye for recognizing patterns and trends. I have also acquired experience in data management and statistical analysis which I think will be valuable skills for my position as a data professional.

In my free time, I like to discover any new data analysis techniques, as I am always searching for a chance to develop my knowledge and abilities. I work well in a team and also independently, and I am motivated by the joy of uncovering new insights and the fulfillment of using data to work out complicated problems.

This is a repository to demonstrate my skills, share projects and record my progress in data analytics.

## Portfolio projects
In this section I will list my data analytic projects and describe the technology used to solve the cases

### Analyzing the Spanish tourism system
**Code**: [`Spanish-tourism.ipynb`](https://github.com/Zoe-Elizabeth/Zoe-Elizabeth91/blob/main/Spanish-tourism.ipynb)

**Goal**: To determine the importance of the tourism sector in Spain.

**Description**: The project focused on analyzing the Spanish tourism system and the importance of foreign tourist arrivals.

**Skills**: Scatterplot, Grid colour, Grid background.

**Technology**: Python, Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib.pyplot
